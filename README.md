# 🚗 Car Price Prediction — From Raw Data to Deployed ML System

> A complete end-to-end Machine Learning project — from raw data exploration to a fully deployed production-ready API and interactive dashboard.

---

## 📖 Project Journey

This project started with a dataset containing car specifications and their prices.  
What began as simple data analysis evolved into a complete Machine Learning system — including preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, deployment, and visualization.

This was not just model training — it was a full real-world ML workflow.

---

## 📊 Phase 1 — Data Understanding

The first step was deeply understanding the dataset.

### Steps taken:

- Explored every column and understood its purpose  
- Checked data types for correctness  
- Analyzed missing values (NaNs)  
- Calculated null percentages  
- Removed duplicate rows  
- Fixed incorrect data types  

Before moving to modeling, I ensured the dataset was clean and logically structured.

---

## 📈 Phase 2 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I created multiple visualizations to better understand:

- Manufacturers distribution  
- Price trends  
- Feature correlations  
- Impact of features on the target variable (price)  

Through visualization, I gained deeper insights into:

- Which features significantly affect price  
- Potential noise in the dataset  
- Patterns that weren't obvious from raw numbers  

This phase gave me confidence to proceed with modeling.

---

## 🧹 Phase 3 — Data Cleaning & Outlier Detection

I created a dedicated preprocessing module where I:

- Detected outliers  
- Visualized their effect on the target variable  
- Removed harmful outliers  
- Re-validated distributions  

After cleaning, I updated my main pipeline to include all improvements.

This step significantly improved model stability and performance.

## ⚙️ Phase 4 — Feature Engineering & Encoding

Features were divided into:

- Label Encoded columns  
- One-Hot Encoded columns  
- Scaled numerical columns  

I built a structured ML pipeline that included:

- Encoding  
- Scaling  
- Model training  

I experimented with two encoding strategies:

- One-Hot Encoding  
- Target Encoding  

---

## 🤖 Phase 5 — Model Experimentation

I trained multiple models and compared performance.

### 🔹 Linear Regression
Accuracy: ~30%

### 🔹 Random Forest Regressor
Accuracy: ~60%

Then I tested Target Encoding:

- Linear Regression accuracy improved  
- But Random Forest with One-Hot Encoding performed better overall  

---

## 🔁 Cross Validation

To ensure model stability and avoid overfitting, I performed:

- Cross-validation on Linear Regression  
- Cross-validation on Random Forest  
- Compared both encoding strategies  

After thorough experimentation, the final chosen model was:

> 🎯 Random Forest Regressor with One-Hot Encoding

---

## 📈 Final Model Performance

After full preprocessing, feature engineering, encoding optimization, and validation:

🚀 Final Accuracy: **81%**

This improvement came from:

- Proper data cleaning  
- Outlier removal  
- Feature engineering  
- Encoding experimentation  
- Cross validation  
- Model comparison  

The result was achieved through systematic experimentation.

## 🌐 Phase 6 — Production Deployment

After finalizing the model, I transformed it into a real application:

### Backend API
- Built using FastAPI  
- Handles prediction requests  
- Loads trained model and preprocessing objects  
- Returns predicted price via API endpoint  

### Dashboard
- Built using Streamlit  
- Includes model insights and visualizations  
- Interactive exploration of data  

This turned the project into a production-ready ML system.
